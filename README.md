# Face Detection with React.js

A simple face detection web application built with React.js that detects faces in images using a face detection API. This project demonstrates how to integrate a machine learning API with a modern web framework to create an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in images using a face detection API.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Shows bounding boxes around detected faces.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple user interface for uploading images and viewing results.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects in functional components.
- **Face Detection API**: A third-party API (e.g., Clarifai, Face++ or OpenCV) to handle face detection.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the API.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
